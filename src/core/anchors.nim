## isonim-docs Layer 3 — heading anchor ID generation (M2 deliverable 3).
##
## Stable rules so table-of-contents, deep links, and later reference
## resolution don't churn: a heading's ID is a lowercase, punctuation-free
## slug of its own text, deduped within one document by a numeric suffix
## on repeat ("-2", "-3", ...) regardless of heading level/nesting -- IDs
## are flat URL fragments, not scoped per section, so dedup has to be
## document-wide. Pure string/table work, no filesystem access, so it's
## Tier-1-testable on both `nim c` and `nim js`, exactly like
## `content.nim`'s pure helpers.

proc slugifyHeadingText*(text: string): string =
  ## Lowercases `text` and collapses every run of non `[a-z0-9]`
  ## characters (punctuation, whitespace, symbols) into a single hyphen,
  ## trimming any leading/trailing hyphen -- stable across punctuation
  ## differences ("Getting Started!" and "Getting, Started" both slugify
  ## to "getting-started").
